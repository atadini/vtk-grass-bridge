1.) Implement a grass module base class which calls the reader and writer
2.) Implement raster to vector modules based on the following algorithmns:
    # vtkProjectedTerrainPath
    # vtkGreedyTerrainDecimation
    # vtkImageToPolyDataFilter  
    # vtkRecursiveDividingCubes
    # 
2.) Implement vector to vector modules based on the following algorithmns:
    # vtkPolyDataPointSampler
    # vtkSmoothPolyDataFilter
    # vtkTriangleFilter
    #
