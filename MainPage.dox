\mainpage vtkGRASSBridge

The purpose of this library is to provide an interface between the grass C libraries and
C++, Python and Java.
It uses the VTK wrapper to support Python and Java.
The support is currently limited to the basic raster map functions of libgrass_gis.

The library was successfully tested with VTK 5.2 and 5.4 and grass 6.4 RC5.
